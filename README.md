# Anomaly Detection for Manufacturing process-ISEN-614
A monitoring scheme for future missions (Phase-II analysis) in order to identify data falling in out-of-control and in-control categories. 

The project is based on a set of data collected from a manufacturing process, in which both in-control and out-of-control data are present. A model (T2 hotelling chart) is built after data preprocessing to detect out-of-control points (anomalies).

Description of the dataset
(a) This is a manufacturing related dataset, and it has a total of 552 data records.
(b) Each row is a data record. Each data record contains 209 values.
(c) This is a multivariate detection dataset in which 𝑝=209. The sample size is 𝑛=1.
(d) The physical meaning of each value is omitted.
