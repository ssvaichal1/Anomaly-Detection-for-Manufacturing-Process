# Anomaly Detection for Manufacturing process-ISEN-614
A monitoring scheme for future missions (Phase-II analysis) in order to identify data falling in out-of-control and in-control categories. 

Description of Course Project:
As a part of the assigned work for this course, you are required to conduct a course project. The purpose of the project is different from doing homework. It is to give you a feeling how to handle a real life dataset, make decisions yourself, and justify your undertaking. Performing this project encourages you to explore an avenue related to, but not limited to, the material in the class. You may need to read additional literature and broaden your knowledge base.
The project is based on a set of data collected from a manufacturing process, in which both in-control and out-of-control data are present. You are asked to develop a method or a procedure to identify the data falling in the respective categories. This is amounted to a Phase I analysis, whose purpose to isolate the in-control data for estimating the in-control distribution parameters so that a monitoring scheme can be set up for future missions.
There is no fixed path in the project execution. Many actions are ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù but it does not mean they will receive the same scores. I want you to treat your own team as a professional analytic team in the following scenario. Pretend that I am a manager of a manufacturing business unit and you are the analytic team supporting the business unit. I have this set of data and want to do a Phase I analysis to the best extent possible, so that I can have the most effective process monitoring set up for my manufacturing process. I do not know how to do it. So I provide the data to your team and ask for help. I need you to make the recommendations to me concerning which part of data samples are the out-of-control points and which are in control, so as for me to compute the in-control parameters. You need to justify your recommendations.
Description of the dataset
(a) This is a manufacturing related dataset, and it has a total of 552 data records.
(b) Each row is a data record. Each data record contains 209 values.
(c) This is a multivariate detection dataset in which ùëù=209. The sample size is ùëõ=1.
(d) The physical meaning of each value is omitted.
